The rightleft package
=====================

This package randomizes the output of \left- and \rightarrows.
In addition to that it allows you to use \rightleftarrow instead of
\leftrightarrow.

Usage
-----

Just add \usepackage{rightleft} to your preamble and dont rely to much on
the correct direction of arrows.

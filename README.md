The rightleft package
=====================

This package randomizes the output of ```\left```- and ```\rightarrow```s.
In addition to that it allows you to use ```\rightleftarrow``` instead of ```\leftrightarrow```.

Installation
------------

Compile ```rightleft.ins``` to create the rightleft.sty and ```rightleft.dtx`` for the documentation and copy the resulting files to the appropriate folders of your TeX installation. Eventually you have to run your indexer again. See [[1]](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Installing_Extra_Packages) for advice.

Usage
-----

Just add ```\usepackage{rightleft}``` to your preamble and dont rely to much on
the correct direction of arrows.
